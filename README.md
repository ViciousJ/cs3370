portsetter CLI project

This was a project for my C++ Software Development class and my first experience using GitHub. In the project I was to create a "setport" command to be used in the Cloud9 CLI environment. The setport command simulates setting a port number for the system to "listen to", along with usage and help file documentation, different flags and options to use with the setport command, setting and reading of environment variable options, English/Spanish language options based on language environment variables, and an included test program. Finally, we were assigned to make changes/updates to another random student's project in the class. We made a fork of their project on GitHub, made the additions to their code, and submitted a pull request.
